**Sakila Database Introduction**

The Sakila sample database was initially developed by Mike Hillyer, a former member of the MySQL AB documentation team. It is intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, and so forth. The Sakila sample database also serves to highlight features of MySQL such as Views, Stored Procedures, and Triggers.

**Sakila Database Installation**

`sakila-schema.sql` and `sakila-data.sql` are merged into `sakila-all.sql` with schema creation at front.
This is to make the initilization of MySQL DB easier.
